<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently preparing to pursue a PhD in Information Systems, with a strong focus on Human–Computer/AI Interaction, Mobile Commerce, and Platform Ecosystems. Driven by a deep curiosity about user behavior and the transformative impact of AI technologies, I am actively seeking academic opportunities and collaborations. Please feel free to contact me at [vitajin101@gmail.com](mailto:vitajin101@gmail.com).

I hold a bachelor’s degree from the [School of Tourism Management](https://stm.sysu.edu.cn/about) at Sun Yat-sen University (中山大学), which is ranked #1 in Mainland China and #3 globally [(ShanghaiRanking 2024)](https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/gras/2024/RS0513). Through rigorous academic training, I developed a strong foundation in quantitative analysis, business strategy, and experimental research methods.

After graduation, I was selected into the highly competitive [Tencent Elite Product Manager Program](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Xg1GtNG6ej3SUq9j6DGoLA)（腾讯产品经理培训生）, with an acceptance rate of just 0.4%. Over nearly three years at Tencent, I advanced to P8 (mid-to-senior level) and worked across both the Livestreaming and Appstore departments. I led large-scale initiatives including a digital goods marketplace with over 700K paying users and a CRM system driven by behavioral analytics. These experiences strengthened my skills in platform architecture, data-driven monetization, and cross-functional leadership.

Since leaving Tencent, I have been committed to building a strong academic foundation in preparation for doctoral research. My current methodological focus includes econometrics, machine learning, and experimental design, with the aim of bridging industry insights and impactful academic research in Information Systems.

For more details about my background and work, please refer to my [CV](CV/cv_vita.pdf).
