<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently preparing to pursue a PhD in Information Systems, with a focus on Human–Computer/AI Interaction, Mobile Commerce, and Platform Ecosystems. Motivated by a deep curiosity about user behavior and the transformative impact of AI technologies, I am actively seeking academic opportunities and collaborations. Please feel free to contact me at [vitajin101@gmail.com](mailto:vitajin101@gmail.com).

I hold a bachelor’s degree from the [School of Tourism Management](https://stm.sysu.edu.cn/about) at Sun Yat-sen University (中山大学旅游学院), ranked #1 in Mainland China and #3 globally [(ShanghaiRanking 2024)](https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/gras/2024/RS0513). Through rigorous academic training, I built a strong foundation in quantitative analysis, business strategy, and experimental methods. During my undergraduate studies, I also interned at <span style="color: blue;">Baidu (百度), Trip.com (携程), China Mobile (中国移动), and the United Nations World Tourism Organization (联合国世界旅游组织)</span>.

After graduation, I was selected into the highly competitive [Tencent Elite Product Manager Program](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Xg1GtNG6ej3SUq9j6DGoLA) (腾讯产品经理培训生), with an <span style="color: #6A0DAD;">acceptance rate of 0.4%</span>. Over nearly three years at Tencent, I advanced to P8 <span style="color: orange;">(mid-to-senior level)</span> and worked across both the Livestreaming and Appstore teams. I led initiatives including a digital goods marketplace with 700K+ paying users and a CRM system powered by behavioral analytics. These experiences enhanced my skills in platform architecture, monetization strategy, and cross-functional leadership.

Since leaving Tencent, I have focused on strengthening my academic foundation for doctoral research. My methodological focus includes econometrics, machine learning, and experimental design, aiming to bridge industry insights with impactful academic research.

For more details about my background and work, please refer to my [CV](CV/cv_vita.pdf).

Led the full lifecycle development of a digital goods marketplace supporting over 730 games, engaging 700K+
paying users and generating monthly GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) of ¥60M+. Focused on end-to-end system
design, data-driven monetization strategies, and user lifecycle management.
- Platform Design & System Architecture: Designed and deployed a modular, scalable marketplace platform for
out-of-game virtual goods. Defined the architecture and process flow covering product catalog management,
payment integration, coupon issuance, and post-sale services.
- CRM System Development: Built a precision customer relationship management system using RFM and CLV
models within the WeCom (Tencent’s enterprise messaging) ecosystem. Engineered behavior-tag-based
segmentation and churn-risk prediction tools to enable targeted, automated engagement, boosting ARPPU
(average revenue per paying user) to ¥600+ and increasing repurchase rates by 20%.
- Data-Driven Pricing & Promotion: Developed and optimized pricing models for the Game Monthly Pass
subscription using perceived value and marginal utility frameworks. Delivered a 3.5x ROI through integrated
pricing, bundling, and promotion mechanisms.
- Product Analytics & Optimization: Applied A/B testing, funnel analysis, and behavioral analytics to iteratively
improve feature performance. Achieved a 17% increase in user conversion and 9% improvement in retention
through data-informed interventions.

## 📱 *2020.07 - 2021.07*, Tencent Live – Product Operations Manager 
Drove user acquisition and content creator activation for Tencent’s livestreaming platform through
community-based strategies and continuous user feedback loops.
- User Research & System Feedback Integration: Conducted over 50 qualitative interviews with streamers to
identify product pain points. Collaborated with engineering to reduce CPU load by 50%, improving system
stability for long-tail streamers.
- UGC Activation via Growth Frameworks: Applied the AARRR growth model to guide viewer-to-streamer
conversion. Designed scalable community-building campaigns and low-barrier event mechanisms, successfully
activating 1,000+ new streamers and generating 8,000+ high-engagement live sessions.
